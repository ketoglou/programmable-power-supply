<img src="Documents/5v_logo.png" width="30%">


## Overview
A power supply which can be programmed through PC and set the voltage from 0-5V with 5mV resolution.

The PC software can monitor Current and Voltage and set voltage and the limit for maximum current.

If the current at output is greater than the limit a buzzer produce a sound.

Minimum load must be 5mA for proper function.

Input voltage can be from 6.5V minimum to 35V maximum.

The project include a flashing led just to know that the microprocessor operates,this led can be set ON/OFF
from the PC software.

Inverse polarity protection included.
